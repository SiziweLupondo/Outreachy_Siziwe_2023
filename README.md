# Land Sector Management and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

🌍 Welcome to the Land Sector Management and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project repository! This project aims to bring together datasets relevant to land sector management in South Africa. In this README file, we will provide you with essential information about the project, the software tools used, and their respective links.

## Project Overview

📋 The Land sector dataset repository is dedicated to aggregating datasets that can be valuable for land sector management in South Africa. These datasets will be used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights and inform decision-making in the land sector.

## Project Details

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Select Your Region**: Choose a specific region within South Africa (e.g., province, state, city) for your analysis. We recommend selecting a region that is of personal interest or relevance to you.

2. **Access Data Library**: Navigate to the data library hosted on Moja Global's Google Drive. Here, you will find various types of data corresponding to the region you selected.

3. **Create a Jupyter Notebook**: 📔 In your project repository, create a Jupyter Notebook. This notebook will be the central place where you perform data analysis on the datasets you found in the data library.

4. **Data Analysis**: 📊 In your Jupyter Notebook, utilize Python and Anaconda (and any other necessary software) to perform data analysis. You should use graphs, plots, dataframes, and other visualization techniques to interpret the data and present your findings effectively.

## Software Used

For this project, you will need the following software tools:

1. **Anaconda**: 🐍 Anaconda is a popular distribution of Python that includes many data science libraries and tools. It provides an integrated environment for data analysis and scientific computing.
