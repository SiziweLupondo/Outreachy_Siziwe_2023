# Overview 
 The primary objective of this research is to comprehensively assess South Africa's progress toward the SDGs. We aim to quantify and qualify advancements made in areas such as poverty reduction, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. Through data analytics, we will examine trends, gaps, and variations in performance at both the national and regional levels.

## Project Details

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Select Your Region**: Choose a specific region within South Africa (e.g., province, state, city) for your analysis. We recommend selecting a region that is of personal interest or relevance to you.

2. **Access Data Library**: Navigate to the data library hosted on Moja Global's Google Drive. Here, you will find various types of data corresponding to the region you selected.

3. **Create a Jupyter Notebook**: üìî In your project repository, create a Jupyter Notebook. This notebook will be the central place where you perform data analysis on the datasets you found in the data library.

4. **Data Analysis**: üìä In your Jupyter Notebook, utilize Python and Anaconda (and any other necessary software) to perform data analysis. You should use graphs, plots, dataframes, and other visualization techniques to interpret the data and present your findings effectively.

# Software Used

The Code is written in Python 3.10
To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
